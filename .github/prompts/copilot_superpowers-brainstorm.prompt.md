description: Start a structured brainstorming dialogue to refine an idea into a validated design/spec before coding.

- Look for the `brainstorming` skill in `.claude/skills/core/` or `.github/skills/core/` and invoke it.
- Follow it exactly: review project context, ask one question at a time, propose 2-3 approaches, then present the design in 200-300 word sections with validation between sections.
- Start by asking the first clarifying question.
