# Copilot Instructions

## NEVER make destructive changes without explicit user approval

Before running ANY command that deletes, overwrites, or reinitializes data (rm -rf, drop, reset, init --force, etc.):

1. **STOP** and describe exactly what will be lost
2. **ASK** for explicit confirmation
3. **Only proceed** after the user says yes

This applies especially to: databases, .beads/, .git/, config files, and any user-created data.

No exceptions. No shortcuts. Ask first.
